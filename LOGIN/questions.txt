Here are 4-5 sample questions for a Software Engineer position, with a moderate level of difficulty:

**Question 1:**

Design an algorithm to find the closest pair of points in a set of n points in 2D space, where each point is represented by its x and y coordinates. Your solution should have a time complexity of O(n log n).

**Question 2:**

Consider a web application that uses a relational database management system. What are the trade-offs between using an index on a column versus creating a composite index on multiple columns? Provide specific examples to support your answer.

**Question 3:**

Suppose you are given a large dataset of customer purchase history, with each row representing a customer's purchase. Write a Python script to identify the top 10 customers who have spent the most money overall. You may assume that the dataset is stored in a Pandas DataFrame.

**Question 4:**

A mobile app uses a reactive UI framework to update the display in real-time. However, upon loading a large dataset, the app experiences significant lag and crashes occasionally. Suggest a solution to improve the app's performance, taking into account factors such as memory usage, network traffic, and UI rendering.

**Question 5:**

Consider a microservices-based architecture where multiple services communicate with each other using RESTful APIs. How would you design a circuit breaker pattern to handle service failures and prevent cascading failures in the system? Justify your design choice with a brief explanation.

These questions assess the candidate's problem-solving skills, technical knowledge, and ability to think critically about software engineering principles and design trade-offs.
